\textbf{Problem 1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The state variables are $B_t$ (barrels of oil left at time $t$) and $p_t$
  \item The control variable is $q_t$, quantity of oil sold at time $t$
  \item The transition equation is given as $B_{t+1} = B_t - q_t$
  \item The sequence equation is given as $V(B_t) = \max_{q_1, q_2,       \cdots} \sum_{t=0}^\infty \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big)^t p_t q_t$ \\ The Bellman equation is given as $V(B_t) = \max_{q_t} p_t q_t + \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big) V(B_{t+1}) $
  \item We can also write the Bellman equation as 
        $$
        V(B_t) = \max_{B_{t+1}} p_t (B_t - B_{t-1}) + \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big) V(B_{t+1})
        $$
        Taking the derivative with respect to $B_{t+1}$, we find
        $$
        p_t = \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big)V'(B_{t+1})
        $$
        $$
        V'(B_t) = p_t + \Big[-p_t + \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big) V'(B_{t+1}) \Big] \tfrac{dB_{t+1}}{dB_t} = p_t
        $$
        So the Euler equation is
        $$
        p_t = \Big( \frac{1}{1+r} \Big)p_{t+1}
        $$
  \item If $p_{t+1} = p_t$ for all $t$, given $r > 0$, it is optimal   to sell all of the oil in the first period. 
        
        If $p_{t+1} > (1 + r)p_t$ for all $t$, then it is optimal to sell oil in the last period - in the infinite case, the owner will never sell oil.
        
        Given this, an interior solution must satisfy $p_t \leq p_{t+1} <
        (1+r) p_t$
        
        
\end{enumerate}
